To build the type inferencer, named gtlc, type 'make'.
To run the inferencer, type:

./gtlc <input-file>

The output will either be the type of the program given in the
input-file, or an error message saying that the program is not
well-typed.

The inferencer is written in Objective Caml and was tested
with version 3.09.2.

The grammar for the input language is as follows.

type ::= variable
       | "int"
       | "bool"
       | "?"
       | type "->" type
       | "(" type ")"

expr ::= variable
       | integer
       | "true"
       | "false"
       | "fun" variable [":" type] "." expr
       | expr expr
       | "let" variable "=" expr "in" expr
       | "(" expr ")"
